# Equity-Portfolio-financial-risk-and-performance-analysis
We will be building a LSTM-based forecasting model for stock price and risk analysis
We have calculated and analyzed key metrics for financial analysis such as Sharpe Ratio, VaR, Beta and Alpha to reduce portfolio risk
We are also developing a dashboard in power BI for easy representation and helping in decision makin
If we achieve a high accuracy i will be pushing this model into an API for eal time predictions as well
